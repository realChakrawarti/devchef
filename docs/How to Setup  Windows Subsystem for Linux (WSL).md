### How to setup Zsh & Oh My Zsh

>**_Zsh_** is a shell designed for interactive use, although it is also a powerful scripting language. Many of the useful features of _bash_, _ksh_, and _tcsh_ were incorporated into zsh; many original features were added.

Oh My Zsh is a community-driven framework for managing your zsh configuration.

```bash
sudo apt install wget
sudo apt install git
sudo apt install zsh
```

- To install and set zsh as default shell: `sh -c "$(wget https://raw.github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/master/tools/install.sh -O -)"

#### To install "powerlevel10k" theme

```bash
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k.git ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-$HOME/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/themes/powerlevel10k
```

- To update the theme in ~/.zshrc file:
	- Open the zsh config file in nano or editor of your choice: `nano ~/.zshrc` and then 
	- Set `ZSH_THEME="powerlevel10k/powerlevel10k"` instead of `ZSH_THEME="robbyrussell"`

Restart the terminal or `exec zsh`, to do the first time setup for the look and feel of the theme. If configuration wizard doesn't show up run `p10k configure`.
